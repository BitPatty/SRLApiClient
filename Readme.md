This repository contains a compact, asynchronous .Net Standard 2.1 wrapper around the [SpeedRunsLive](http://speedrunslive.com) API. The client is available via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SRLApiClient).

```bash
#.Net
dotnet add package SRLApiClient

#Package Manager
Install-Package SRLApiClient
```

---

## Features

The client supports synchronous and asynchronous GET requests on the following endpoints:
- Countries
- Games
- Leaderboards
- Races
- Past Races
- Players
- User

Authentication via HTTP is supported to update user profiles. POST/PUT requests on other endpoints are not possible, since users are missing the required privileges.

The client also supports a user defined number of HTTP clients. Using a pool size of > 10 is not recommended.
